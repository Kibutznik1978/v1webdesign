# 💼 FreshSites — $500 Website Build & Hosting Service

## 🧠 Project Goal

This project aims to build a lean, repeatable system that allows me to deliver **modern, mobile-friendly websites** to small business clients for a flat fee of **$500**, with optional **managed hosting and monthly maintenance** plans starting at $15/month.

The websites will be fast, lightweight, easy to deploy, and simple to hand off or manage long term. The process will leverage Claude Code or other AI coding agents, integrated into my IDE (e.g., VS Code or Cursor), to automate and accelerate delivery while maintaining high-quality output.
