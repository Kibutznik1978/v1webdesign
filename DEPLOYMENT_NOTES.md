# V1 Web Design - Deployment Notes

## Form Configuration Required

Before going live, you need to set up form handling:

### Option 1: Formspree (Recommended)
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create an account and new form
3. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in index.html with your actual Formspree form ID
4. Both contact forms currently point to: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`

### Option 2: Netlify Forms
If deploying to Netlify:
1. Add `netlify` attribute to both form tags
2. Change action to just action="/" 
3. Netlify will automatically handle form submissions

## Content Updates Needed

1. **Phone Number**: Replace `(760) XXX-XXXX` with actual phone number
2. **Email**: Confirm `hello@v1webdesign.com` is correct
3. **About Section**: Replace `[Your Name]` and `[Year]` with actual information
4. **Contact Info**: Update structured data with real phone number
5. **Repository URL**: Update GitHub repository URL in package.json
